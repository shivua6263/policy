## Issues & Solutions

| Issue | Check |
|-------|-------|
| No console logs | Is DevTools open? Is it Console tab? Refresh page? |
| Button doesn't respond | Are you on account.html page? Try hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R) |
| File dialog doesn't open | Check console for errors, screenshot and share |
| POST request fails | Check if Django is running on port 8000 |
